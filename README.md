# Toto's Cool Libraries

This is a set of public domain, single-header C libraries that you may find useful, inspired by [nothings' stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

Each library is independant from one another, except for the Entity Component System (`ecs.h`) that uses functionality from the other files.

## Warning!

`string.h` is kinda unfinished!
